 # Authentification
 
 By default, a Twitch app is limited to **30 requests per minute**.
 It is okay if you are alone on it, otherwise you will quickly reach the limit, especially if you request for confidential streams which require many requests to handle Twitch pagination.
 
 With authentification, you will have a limit of **800 requests per minute**, which is greatly enough.
